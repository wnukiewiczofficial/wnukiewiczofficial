<h1 align="left">Hi 👋, I'm David</h1>
<h3 align="left">About me</h3>
<p align="left">
  I'm a full-stack developer building websites, applications, and games from concept to deployment. I've worked as both a freelance developer and a full-stack programmer, gaining experience in commercial web-based games, static websites, full-stack web applications, RESTful APIs, and mobile apps.
</p> 
<p align="left">
  I work across the entire stack—from interactive frontends to robust backends and database management. I'm comfortable with modern frameworks, containerization, and cloud deployment.
</p>
<p align="left">
  When I'm not working on projects, I'm experimenting with new technologies and refining my skills.
