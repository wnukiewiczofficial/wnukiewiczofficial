<h1 align="left">Hi 👋, I'm David</h1>
<h3 align="left">About me</h3>
<p align="left">
  I'm a full-stack developer building websites, applications, and games from concept to deployment. I've worked as both a freelance developer and a full-stack programmer, gaining experience in commercial web-based games, static websites, full-stack web applications, RESTful APIs, and mobile apps.
  I work across the entire stack—from interactive frontends to robust backends and database management. I'm comfortable with modern frameworks, containerization, and cloud deployment.
  When I'm not working on projects, I'm experimenting with new technologies and refining my skills.
